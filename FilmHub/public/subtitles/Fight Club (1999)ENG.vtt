00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
Current reports, until you advise a status upgrade.

00:02.800 --> 00:04.440
Make these your primary action items.

00:04.440 --> 00:05.440
I couldn't sleep.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.520
No, you can't die from insomnia.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.400
I'd flip through catalogs and wonder,

00:09.400 --> 00:12.760
what kind of dining set defines me as a person?

00:12.760 --> 00:15.800
This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.

00:15.800 --> 00:16.920
Welcome!

00:16.920 --> 00:18.600
I prayed for a different life.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.920
Soap.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.280
I make, and I soak, and I soak.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.280
This is how I met Tyler Durden.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.120
Come on, hit me before I lose my nerve.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.480
Ow!

00:28.480 --> 00:30.440
Hit me in the ear!

00:30.440 --> 00:33.080
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.120
Can I be next?

00:34.120 --> 00:35.320
We just gave it a name.

00:35.320 --> 00:38.400
Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.720
The first rule of Fight Club is...

00:40.720 --> 00:41.880
Wow, nice.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.840
You do not talk about Fight Club.

00:44.840 --> 00:45.840
Is that your blood?

00:47.720 --> 00:49.200
Some of it, yeah.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.600
After Fight Club, we all started seeing things differently.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.720
You're gonna have to keep me up all night.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.160
And she ruined everything.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.320
You're not into her, are you?

01:00.320 --> 01:02.600
No, God, not at all.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.280
If all had been raised on television to believe

01:04.280 --> 01:06.040
that one day we'd all be millionaires

01:06.040 --> 01:08.240
and movie gods and rock stars,

01:08.240 --> 01:09.640
but we won't.

01:09.640 --> 01:10.640
He had a plan.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.080
To what purpose?

01:15.080 --> 01:16.520
In Tyler, we trusted.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.400
We gotta take a Fight Club up a notch.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.960
Each one of you has a homework assignment.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.160
You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.440
That's not necessary.

01:26.560 --> 01:27.560
You're gonna lose.

01:28.760 --> 01:29.760
That hurt.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.760
You were looking for a way to change your life.

01:34.760 --> 01:35.760
You got it.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.120
I'm stopping this.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.120
It's already done. Shut up.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.960
We're gonna sick game when you play.

01:42.960 --> 01:43.960
Oh, my God.

01:43.960 --> 01:44.960
Where is my mind?

01:44.960 --> 01:45.960
You kid.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.960
Where is my mind?

01:47.960 --> 01:51.960
Where is my mind?

01:51.960 --> 01:53.960
This is too much.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.960
In the end, you will thank me.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.480
Wow!

01:57.480 --> 01:58.480
Wow!

01:59.480 --> 02:01.480
If you could find anyone, who would you find?

02:01.480 --> 02:02.480
Shatner.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.480
I'd find William Shatner.
