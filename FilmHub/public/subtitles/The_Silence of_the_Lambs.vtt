And he's never impulsive, he'll never stop.

00:04.680 --> 00:06.840
But in order to track him down,

00:06.840 --> 00:08.680
she'll have to match wits.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.720
I'll help you catch him, Clary.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.320
Well, you'd mean you don't want to have a doctor inside your head

00:14.320 --> 00:16.920
with the darkest of all minds.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.960
Just do your job, I have a forget what he is.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.600
But he's a monster.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.960

00:32.160 --> 00:34.520

00:34.520 --> 00:37.600
You told me you don't smoothies what he is.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.040
You call this easy term?

00:40.040 --> 00:42.040
Left is missing hand-borne.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.040
Man, it's a rating, man.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.680
You have to know as well, though.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.920
Thank you, Clary.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.480
Thank you.
