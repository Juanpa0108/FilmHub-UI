00:00.000 --> 00:27.000
The General became a slave, the slave became a gladiator, the gladiator defied an emperor, only a famous death would do.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
The Frost sometimes it makes the blade stick around.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
You find yourself alone, riding in green fields with a son on your face, you're not be troubled.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
While you are in an easy-up, and you're already dead!

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm alone!

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
What we do in life, and goes in eternity.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
I love you, Spaniard.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I love you.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
My name is Maximus Desnis Maria.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Loyal servant to the true emperor of the Marcus Aurelius.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Father to a murdered son has been to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
This life will be next.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than you in progress.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Strengthen on us, Strengthen on us.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
A young man who once said death smiles at us all, I'm all in that and do a smile back.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Smile for me now.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm all in love.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm all in love, I'm all in love!

02:30.000 --> 02:40.000
Why are you not entertained? Why are you not entertained?
