00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
God seems like a thousand years ago.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I fought my way out of that cave.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
It came higher, man.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Realize that loved you.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I knew I said no more surprises,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
but I was really hoping to pull off one last one.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
But the world has changed.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
None of us can go back.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
All we can do is our best.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
And sometimes the best we can do.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
This is the start over.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
I still hold these people down.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I can tell everybody they should move on.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Some do.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
The man is.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Even if there's a small chance.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
We owe this.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
To everyone who's not in this room to try.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
We will.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Whatever it takes.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Whatever it takes.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Whatever it takes.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Whatever it takes.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Whatever it takes.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I like this one.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Whatever it takes.
