00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
How am I doing for a GZD and his brother?

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
I don't want to run to him.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
It's bad, Axelado.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
You know, if we took him out of the water, he would hunt on land.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
What would he hunt?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Anything that moves?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Then's mother passed away a few months ago.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
That was an old deed for her coastal property.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Lead leads yours to do with this you wish.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
My mother never once mentioned this.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Some families have secrets.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
What's the end of the summer?

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
There's the autumn breeze.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
The bed?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Look at this.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
It's incredible.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
I have a buyer who's interested.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
They've made a strong offer.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Is that serious?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
I love you.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
The badger drew himself up.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Took a firm grip with this stick

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
and flung the trap door of wider pain.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
What is it?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
It's a water tank.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
All these old types of places would have run off rainwater.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Hello?

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Let me go there.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
What do you think it is?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
I don't know.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
I don't know.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
I don't know.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Oh, sweetie.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Something's trying to get out.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh, no.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
There's nothing we can do.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Get your feelings home.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
The tank was open.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
My mother wasn't crazy like they thought.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I'm tired.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
It knows we're here.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
There's nothing we can do.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Something we have secrets.
