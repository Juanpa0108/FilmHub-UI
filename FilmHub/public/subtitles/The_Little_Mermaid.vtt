00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Oh, I thought that!

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
I got it, shit!

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Take the comb there!

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Over here!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
You broke the rules.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
You went to the above world.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
A man was drowning.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
I had to save him.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
This obsession with humans has to stalk.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I just want to know more about them.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Ariel! Don't!

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
God, child!

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I can help you.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
You can't live in that world and us.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
You become a human yourself.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Is that even possible?

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh, that's what I live for.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Something about you seems different.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I can't quite figure it out.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
She got legs!

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah, idiot.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
He's a human.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
You're a mermaid.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
That doesn't make us enemies.
