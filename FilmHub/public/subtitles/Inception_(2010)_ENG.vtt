00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Some conscious security.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
You're talking about dreams.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Mr. Carl has a job offer he would like to discuss with you.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
We can't work, Placement.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Not exactly.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
We create the world of the dream.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
We bring the subject into that dream.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
And they fill it with their secrets.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Then you break it and still it.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Well, it's not strictly speaking legal.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
It's called inception.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Already?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I think I found a way home.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
And this last job.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
That's how I get there.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Dreams.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Feel real while we're in them.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
It's only when we wake up that we realize something's actually strange.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
This is all responsibility.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
We're not prepared to this.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Dreams collapsing.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Have it under control.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I need to see out of control.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
It mustn't be afraid to dream in a little bigger darling.
