00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Hello, my name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Would you like a chocolate?

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Oh, thank you.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
It's funny what a young man recollects.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
You're the same as everybody else.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
You are no different.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Your boy's different.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Are you stupid or something?

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm as stupid as a stupid does.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm Jenny.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I'm Forrest Gump.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
She was my most special friend.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
My only friend.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
We was together all the time.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
We was like peas and carrots, Jenny and I.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Run, Forrest!

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
He's stupid!

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Run!

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Now, you wouldn't believe it if I told you,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
but I could run like the wind blows.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Who in the hell is that?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Now, they are as far as Gump, Coach.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Just a local idiot.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
I never thought it would take me anywhere.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
They even put me on a thing called the All-America team.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Well, you get to meet the president of the United States.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Congratulations.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
How does it feel to be an All-American?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I gotta pee.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I believe you said you had to go pee.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Now, maybe it's just me, but...

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
college was very confusing times.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
I sit next to them in my home economics class all the time.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Have you given any thought to your future?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Go!

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
What the hell?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Your future?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Go!

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
What's your sole purpose in this army?

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
You're damn genius.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You are going to be a general someday, Gus.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
They sent me to Vietnam.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
So you promised me something, okay?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
If you're ever in trouble, don't try to be brave.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
You just run, okay?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Okay.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Where are you boys from in the world?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Alabama, sir.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
You twins?

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
No, we are not relations, sir.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Some reason what I was doing seemed to make sense to people.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Forget about me! Get yourself out!

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
You've been awarded the Medal of Honor.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
I can't.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Now, my momma's always telling me how miracles happen every day.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Forrest!

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Some people don't think so.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Jenny!

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
But they do.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
You can come home with me at my house in Greenbow.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I'll take care of you.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Why are you so good to me?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
You're my girl.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Paramount Pictures presents...

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Tom Hanks.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm not a smart man.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
But I know what love is.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Robin Wright.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Will you marry me?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
You would, Forrest.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
But you won't marry me.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Gary Sinise.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I never thanked you for saving my life.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
And Sally Field.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
My boy Forrest is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
A film by Robert Zemeckis.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
What's my destiny, Mom?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
You're going to have to figure that out for yourself.

03:16.000 --> 03:30.000
The world will never seem the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
My mom always said life was like a box of chocolates.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
You never know what you're going to get.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Forrest Gump presents...

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Tom Hanks.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Will you marry me?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm not a smart man.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
But I know what love is.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
You would, Forrest Gump.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
I'm not a smart man.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
But you won't marry me.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
I'd make a good husband.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I'd make a good husband.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I'm not a smart man.
