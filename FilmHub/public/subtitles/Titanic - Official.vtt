00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
Deuteronous

00:14.640 --> 00:16.900
Tintanid was called, the ship of dreams.

00:16.920 --> 00:20.260
And it was! It really was!

00:20.280 --> 00:22.680
Alright. Open your eyes.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
We're going full the heat, will you fix it to it?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I've got everything I need right here with me.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
I figured life's a gift and I don't intend on wasting it.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
I never know what hand or going to get dealt next.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
You'll learn to take life as it comes at you.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
When this ship talks, I'm getting off with you.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
We're both doing well, something completed because of my blood on you.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
I've got everyone here at your best to support me.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Time's up.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
One, two, three.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
The world is nothing.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
There's nothing to say.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
It will happen.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
This is the night.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Hold on.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Hold on.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Hold on.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Hold on.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Do not let go of my hand.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I'll never let go.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
I'll never let go of my hand.
