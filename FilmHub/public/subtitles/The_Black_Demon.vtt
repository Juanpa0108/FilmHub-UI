00:01.000 --> 00:03.000
Have you spotted any pirate ships?

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
Duh, duh!

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Where are you going to get snappy with us, Bob?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Yeah, because we're supposed to Mexico,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
but we're going to have to find out.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Get over here.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
You know, actually, I think there was a good restaurant right up here.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Whoa.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
That has changed in the last time we were here.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
My name is Paul Sturgis.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I work for Nixon oil.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I used to ferry out to the rig from here.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Don't I think I see it? Is that it?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Yep, that's her.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I'm here to do the inspection.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
What is it?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Look, it's young.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Protection from what?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
What?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
No!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Anybody there!

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Where the hell is everyone?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
What's going on here?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
What is that?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Is that dog?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
The black female.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
There must be some way off this rig.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Nothing works.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
I don't think it can take much more punishment.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
This is not just any shark. It's a curse.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Draw it on not my nature, but my wrath.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Wrath.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
He's going to keep getting his revenge.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Until this happened.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I don't think he can take much more punishment.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
This is not just any shark.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
It's a curse.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Draw it on not my nature, but my wrath.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Wrath.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
He's going to keep getting his revenge.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Until this sacrifice has been made.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
You're only going to stop it.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
It's the killer.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I have a plan.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
You will not take my family away from me.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
You're the monster.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I hope you're right.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
I know a big ass shark when I see one.
