Steven Spielberg presents Back to the Future, a Robert Zemeckis film.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.480
Marty leads an ordinary life.

00:13.480 --> 00:17.000
No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.680
The history is going to change.

00:19.680 --> 00:24.240
And 1985 is not his year.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.480
But Dr. Brown is about to change all that.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.480
Are you telling me that you built a time machine?

00:28.480 --> 00:30.480
What about the warrior?

00:30.480 --> 00:35.480
He's sending Marty 30 years back in time.

00:35.480 --> 00:37.480
It works!

00:37.480 --> 00:40.480
It's a floating saucer from outer space!

00:40.480 --> 00:43.480
Now he's trapped in the past.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.480
He's got to be a dream.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.480
About to meet.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.480
Chocolate.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.480
His future father.

00:48.480 --> 00:49.480
He's a baby.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.480
He's tough.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.480
Wow!

00:51.480 --> 00:54.480
And he's making an impression on his mother.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.480
He's an absolute dream.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.480
And he can sleep in my room.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.480
And if you do, can I have series repercussions on future events?

01:02.480 --> 01:06.480
Now he's got to make his mother and father fall in love.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.480
It's quite a lot.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.480
I haven't even been born yet.

01:08.480 --> 01:14.480
And only Dr. Brown can help him get back to the future.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.480
Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?

01:17.480 --> 01:18.480
Precisely.

01:18.480 --> 01:19.480
Michael J. Fox.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.480
Whoa, this is heavy.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.480
Christopher Lloyd.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.480
There's that word again, heavy.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.480
Why are things so heavy in the future?

01:24.480 --> 01:27.480
Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

01:27.480 --> 01:29.480
Back to the future.
