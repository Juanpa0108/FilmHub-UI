00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
What did you see?

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Paul.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
There's a crusade coming.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Do you often dream things that happen

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
just as you dream them?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
No.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I don't.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I don't.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I don't.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I don't.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I don't.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I don't.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Just as you dream them?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Yes.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
The test is simple.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Remove your hand from the box

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
and you die.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Once in a box.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Pain.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
You inherit too much power.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
You have proven you can rule yourself.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Now you must learn to rule others.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Something none of your ancestors learned.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
My father rules an entire planet.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
He's losing it.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
He's getting a richer one.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
He'll lose that one too.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Arrakis is a death trap.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I'll kill them.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
This is an extermination.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
They're picking my family off one by one.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Let's fight like demons.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
An animal caught in a trap

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
will gnaw off its own leg to escape.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
What will you do?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Paul.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I know you.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
One day

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
the legend will be born.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
All of civilization depends on it.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
The future.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I can see it.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I must not fear.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I must not fear.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Fear is the mind killer.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Hello Duke.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Where the fear is gone

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
only I will remain.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Go, go, go!

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
THE END
