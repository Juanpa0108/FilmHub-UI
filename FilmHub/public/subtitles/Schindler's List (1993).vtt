00:30.000 --> 00:48.000
I'd make sure it's known that companies don't business, I'd see that it had a certain

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
punch.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
That's what I'm good at, not the work, not the work.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
The presentation.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Kibasa sausage, cheeses, look at caviar.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
And of course, who could live without German cigarettes?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Yes, men as you can find.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
It's more fresh fruit.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
The real rareties are in its limits, my number.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I mean, several boxes of jewels are ghast.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
The best.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
And dark ones we can chocolate.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
But in the shape of Ladyfingers.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
The chunk of chocolate.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Because my hands are set with wine tastings.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
900, not make it 10.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
For Wednesday, all this stuff here goes to matters just right now.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
But not the worker.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I expect to be compensated.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
He's all of this?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
He's on his arms now.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
He's on his arms now.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
He's on his arms now.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Stand!

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Stand!

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
He's on his arms!

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Stop the train!

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I was here!

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Stop the train!

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I woke up from a dream this morning.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
I was broke and sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
No, I want to start.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Do you have any questions, sir?

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah, I was top-down and fucking freezing.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I don't know what's on there.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Can you hear me, sir?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Stop the train!

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Stop the train!

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Stop the train!

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Stop the train!

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
You can't shoot!

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Stop the train!

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Stop the train!

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Stop the train!

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Stop the train!

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
There's no pocket.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I have to find every rack.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Better than a pound, sir.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
The list is life.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
All alone.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
It's my chance to raise the cuff.
