Anything we can do.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Not unless you can change the past.

King?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Have you got your Lions crossed?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
You know my father?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Correction?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
He died.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
How long time ago?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Nope, thrown again.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
And the one true king.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
You see, he lives in you.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
You must take your place in the circle of life.
