00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
What if they were unable to wake from that dream?

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
How would you know the difference between the dream and the real?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
It's the question that drives us here.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
What is the matrix?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
And it's the question that drives us here.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
What is the matrix?

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

00:57.000 --> 01:04.000
You are a slave born into a prison for your mind.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
The matrix is a system meal.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
That system is our enemy.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Try to realize the truth.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
But truth.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
There is no spirit.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Human beings are diseased.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
A cancer of this planet to your plague.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And we are the cure.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
So your hair is saved in the world.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I'm trying to free your mind near.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
But I can only show you the dome.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
You're the one that has to walk through it.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
It seems that you've been living two lives.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Men have emptied entire clips of them and hit nothing but air.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Everyone who was fought an agent has died.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
But where they have failed, you will succeed.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
So do you need guns?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Lots of guns.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
No one has ever done anything like this.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
That's why it's going to work.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Master Anders.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
No, be it.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
What?
