00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
The lake, whoop.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
How do we have to fly?

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
It's an Indian surveillance drone.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Solar sales power and entire farm.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
What you doing, Murphy?

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
I know she didn't do nothing. Murphy is long.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
You're a well-educated man, whoop.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
And a trained pilot.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
And an engineer.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
The world doesn't need any more engineers.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
We didn't want out of planes and television sets.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
We ran out of food.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Dad, why are you joining me after something that's bad?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Oh, we didn't.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Murphy's law?

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Murphy's law doesn't mean it's something bad.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
What happened?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
It means it whatever can happen.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
What happened?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
We must confront the reality

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
that nothing in our solar system can help us.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
No, you need to tell me how much plane is a zoo world.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
We're not meant to save the world.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
We're meant to leave it.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
And this is the mission we'll be able to train for.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I've got kids, professor.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Get out there and save them.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Not knowing you're going to die.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm coming back.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
We must reach far beyond our lifespans.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
We must think, not as individuals.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
But as a species.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
We must confront the reality of interstellar traveling.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Murphy, I love you forever.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I'm coming back.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
You're a weapon.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
You're a weapon.
