30-plus years of service, combat metals, citations, only managed to down 3 enemy planes

00:18.640 --> 00:24.720
in the last 40 years.

00:24.720 --> 00:43.600
You can't get a promotion, won't retire, despite your best effort you refuse to die.

00:43.600 --> 00:47.200
You should be at least a two-star Admiral by now.

00:47.200 --> 00:52.200
That here you are, Captain.

00:52.200 --> 00:56.200
What is that?

00:56.200 --> 00:57.200
It's one of Life's Mysteries, sir.

01:48.200 --> 01:54.200
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.200
You kind of said it for extinction.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.200
Maybe so, sir.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.200
But not today.
