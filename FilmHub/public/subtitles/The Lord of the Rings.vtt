00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Do they Gandalf?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
The weapon of the enemy is a gift.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Let us use it against who cannot wield it.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Manila's cat.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
The ring must be destroyed.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
It was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Only there can it be undone.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
I know what I must do.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
I'm afraid to do it.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Manila's not simply walking to Mordor.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
There is no other way.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
There's something down there.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
My precious.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
You frightened.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Yes.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Not merely frightened enough.
