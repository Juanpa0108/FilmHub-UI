00:00.000 --> 00:11.280
What do you want me to do when I'm back with all of them?

00:11.280 --> 00:16.640
I come to me and say, I'm calling on the given dust, you're calling me my house and

00:16.640 --> 00:19.120
you're the last little murderner.

00:19.120 --> 00:25.840
I ask you for justice, that is not justice.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.120
They want to get mixed up in the family business.

00:29.120 --> 00:32.800
You got to get a close like this, but I've been your bloody brains all over your nice side really soon.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.480
You give a one message I want, so that's all.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.920
Now that's all I want, we go to the family.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.720
Now the other families want to sell their heads to the house.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.280
I thought that would put a hidden business, not a person.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.240
They shot my father.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.040
He was the truth.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.960
Your father was business, not a person.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.520
You know my father, man I come here to kill him.

00:55.840 --> 01:05.600
I never wanted this for you.

01:08.160 --> 01:17.840
I work my own life, I don't support us, they care my family and I refuse to be a fool dancing

01:17.840 --> 01:21.200
on a string held by all those fake shards.

01:21.200 --> 01:34.160
It's not personal, it's strictly business.
